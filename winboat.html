    <h1>How to use Winboat</h1>
    <p>Winboat will NOT work  if you have less than 4 GiB of RAM and 2 CPU cores.</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Download your version of Winboat from <a href="https://www.winboat.app/#download">this site</a> and install it.</li>
        <li>Continue through the slides until you see one called "Pre-Requisites". Check the bottom to see if FreeRDP is installed. If not, install the Flatpak by running <a href="https://github.com/FreeRDP/FreeRDP/wiki/PreBuilds#stable">these commands</a>.</li>
        <li>Check if you have Docker installed. If you do not, I recommend switching the dropdown to Podman because it is easier to install and use. If you prefer to use Docker, follow the instructions at the links Winboat provides you.</li>
        <li>
            How to install Podman Compose:
            <ol>
                <li>Install your distribution's version of Podman from <a href="https://podman.io/docs/installation#installing-on-linux">here</a>. If not listed, get the <a href="https://flathub.org/en/apps/io.podman_desktop.PodmanDesktop">Flatpak</a>.</li>
                <li>
                    Use pip to install Compose:<br>
                    <blockquote>pip3 install podman-compose<br></blockquote>
                    If that doesn't work, try installing using your package manager, or manually, according to <a href="https://github.com/containers/podman-compose?tab=readme-ov-file#package-repositories">these instructions</a>.
                </li>
            </ol>
        </li>
        <li>Continue through the next few screens, following Winboat's instructions, and wait for Windows to install. (It's going to take a long time!)</li>
        <li>Once Windows is finished installing, stop the virtual machine with the big red square button, then hit the play button when it's done. (This will restart Windows, which can prevent some common errors.)</li>
        <li>Wait until the Winboat API is Online, then switch to the "Apps" tab and open Microsoft Edge, (or open Windows Store and install your preferred browser).</li>
        <li>
            Copy and paste this link into the browser:<br>
            <blockquote><a href="https://portal.office.com/account">https://portal.office.com/account</a><br></blockquote>
        </li>
        <li>Sign in with your Microsoft account, then switch to the "Apps & devices" tab and click the "Install Office" button to download the installer.</li>
        <li>Once it's finished downloading, close Edge and open File Explorer. Find the installer in your Downloads folder and run it.</li>
        <li>If you're using a school account: Go through all the steps until you reach the "Stay signed in to all your apps" page. Unselect the "Allow my organization to manage my device" option because this causes problems with virtual machines. Then press "Ok".</li>
        <li>Once the installer is finished, close File Explorer and restart the virtual machine again (step 6).</li>
        <li>Now Microsoft Word should be one of the apps on your "Apps" tab! Since this is essentially an entire Windows installation running through a virtual machine, you can install Onedrive on it to sync your files if you wish.</li>
    </ol>
